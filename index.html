            <p>This is an archive of in-house training materials developed by the <a href="https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/" rel="external">Advanced Research Computing Team</a> at the University of Leeds. For an easy-to browse overview of course material, please visit our <a href="https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/courses/" rel="external">website</a>.</p>
            <p>For some of our courses, we may use external public materials which are linked separately below. Our materials are designed to work both
                as a basis for synchronous training sessions, as as documentation for self-directed study. This also facilitates flipped-learning, allowing you to prepare before a session.
            </p>
            <p>This will be updated as our courses evolve and change. Please check our <a href="https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/courses/" rel="external">website</a> to book training.</p>
